## Objective
To answer the question: *How do experience level, geography, company size, and remote work arrangements influence salaries in data science globally?*

## Contents
- **Poster**: [Download the final poster](./Salary_Trend_Across_Globe_Dashboard.pdf)
- **Dataset**: [ds_salaries.csv](./ds_salaries.csv)
- **R Code**: [Salary_Trends_Across_Globe.R](./Salary_Trends_Across_Globe.R)

## Tools Used
- **R**: ggplot2, tidyverse, patchwork
- **Adobe Illustrator**: Poster creation
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle DS Salaries Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)

## Key Findings
- Senior-level roles in the US offer the highest median salaries.
- Remote work increases salaries, especially in fully remote roles in developed regions.
- Leadership roles provide the highest compensation globally.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `ds_salaries.csv` to review the dataset.
3. Open the `Salary_Trends_Across_Globe.R` script in RStudio.
4. Run the script line by line to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
5. The generated plots can be saved as PDFs and used for presentations.

## Results
- **Top Regions for Salaries**: Senior-level roles in the United States lead with the highest salaries, exceeding $150K annually, followed by Europe and Canada. Emerging regions like India and Southeast Asia have significantly lower pay for similar roles.
- **Remote Work Trends**: Fully remote roles offer higher salaries in developed markets like the US and Europe, while emerging markets show less salary differentiation based on remote flexibility.
- **Job Categories**: Leadership roles and ML/AI specialists consistently rank as the highest-paid positions globally, with the US leading in both categories.
- **Company Size**: Salaries increase significantly with company size, particularly in the US and Europe. Emerging markets show smaller differences in pay based on company size.
- **Regional Trends**: The US and Europe have more evenly distributed salary ranges, reflecting mature job markets, whereas India and Southeast Asia have larger gaps between entry-level and senior roles, indicating emerging market dynamics.

- ## Future Scope
- **Economic Factors**: Integrate regional economic indicators like GDP, cost of living, and tax rates to provide context for salary trends and disparities across markets.
- **Expanded Analysis**: Include demographic factors such as gender, education level, and industry type to deepen insights into salary trends.
- **Time-Series Data**: Extend the analysis with more recent datasets to capture salary trends in the post-pandemic era.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to predict salaries based on variables like experience level, geography, and remote work setup.
- **Cross-Dataset Comparisons**: Compare this dataset with other publicly available salary datasets to identify broader global trends.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: An interactive Tableau dashboard has already been developed for dynamic exploration of the data. You can access it on [GitHub](https://github.com/mkarodka/Salary-Analysis-Tableau) or directly view it on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mugdha.karodkar8566/viz/Salary_Analysis_Tableau_Dashboard/Salary_Analysis_Tableau_Dashboard).
